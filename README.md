Sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews.
The problem is that the review is in a textual form and the model should understand the sentiment of the review and automate a result.
The sample dataset consists of 1000 reviews from an un-named restaurant.
The aim is to predict the sentiment of the review(Positive or negative).
